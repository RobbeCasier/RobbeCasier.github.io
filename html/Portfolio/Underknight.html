	The project I worked on when I did my internship at TruePlayers
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
	2 of the tasks I completed I was allowed to show here
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;">
	Perk Manager
	</div>
	<div style="text-align:center">
	When I started, they had all logic that the perks needed in almost entirely one file. There weren't that many perks but it is not managable when more would be added.
	So I asked if I could try my hands on a better way, it was already marked as things that had to be done, but didn't yet decided when it would need to get changed.
	Perks can increase stats, but could also do things (throwing knifes).
	I decided that perks all would be derived from a base class.
	Something that also was needed to be concidered was the fact that like "Throwing Knifes" have object that needed to be loaded. Ofcourse pooling had to be done.
	And also perks could be upgraded when you select the perk multiple times.
	A way I decided to do this was to let the "Perk Manager" create each perk, this would than lead to them creating a pool if neccesary.
	All the intensive operation would be done when the game gets launched.
	When the perk would be enabled it would be added to a list that is used to know which perks need to be updated. And also gets its amount increased.
	Another script would store all the prefabs of the required object that the perks need to be pooled.

	<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;">
	Damage display
	</div>
	<div style="text-align:center">
	Originally they wanted to have health bars with a damage display similar to the one the use in Elden Ring. I did ask if it would be better to have damage being displayed on screen around the enemy instead of having it above the healthbar.
	Although they really did want the damage being displayed on above the health bar. I was allowed to do some research what other games do. I presented them the research I did where I noticed that a lot of games to the same by displaying damage around the enemy on screen.
	I was allowed to work on my idea. It was also well received by the discord community they have.
